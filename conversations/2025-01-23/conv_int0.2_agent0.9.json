That empathy changed my approach; instead of just offering advice, I collaborated with them, leading to a better outcome for both of us. It really reinforced the idea that understanding others often requires emotional investment.",

That emotional insight guided me to choose a position that felt right for me, leading to greater satisfaction in my work.",

I often talk things over with trusted friends or write my thoughts down, which can clarify my feelings. Sometimes, I also engage in activities like going for a walk or listening to music, which allows me to process my emotions better. These strategies help me balance my feelings with rational thinking, leading to more thoughtful decisions.",
